What is eGaaS?
********************************************************************************

eGaaS is a universal blockchain-platform for organizing of economical, governmental and social activities of citizens and their communities in planetary scales. eGaaS proposes mechanism protected from falsification for facts saving and usage of them for creation of any contracts that  regulate relationships between people and organizations. 

In spite of other existed blockchain-projects trying to solve local tasks, eGaaS offers the complex solution for shifting of all instruments needed for governmental and business management on blockchain-platform. eGaaS provides the mechanism for creation of object registries included in legal and economical relations of individuals and legal entities, properties, securities and ect. eGaaS gives the opportunity for Central Banks to open accounts for all citizens and organizations, allowing to conduct transactions in national currency. eGaaS supports the technology of smart contracts needed for business operations. The smart contracts automatically implement the algorithm of deals with objects registry using transactions between the central bank's accounts. 

The mechanism of formation and usage of smart laws is implemented in eGaaS first in the world. Smart laws are the electronic algorithms describing norms and terms of governmental laws performance, which are proved by electronic signatures of representatives of legislature or through the referendum. Smart laws regulate the creation and implementation of smart contracts and automatically regulate the relations between citizens and organizations in all spheres of governmental activities (from civil status registration to payment of tax).

Thus eGaaS combines financial system, the structure of registries, mechanisms of smart contracts and smart laws into one blockchain platform, providing state, citizens and business with full instrument for governing of any activity.

Technical implementation
********************************************************************************
According to the technical view, eGaaS is an open blockchain platform designed for implementation of sophisticated applications (e-government level) working with distributed registries. Special languages are used for description of transactions and interfaces.

Contract itself is a basic construction for implementation of apps algorithms. The completed fragments of code are designed in a form of contracts, which ensure taking of incoming data from user or other contract, analysis of dataâ€™s correctness and implementation of the needed transactions. The language of contracts is a scripting language with a fast compilation into bite code, containing the needed set of functions for creation of registries and performing of any kind of transactions with records in them. 

The attached language of page templates description allows: 
* To simplify the writing of contracts interface 
* To optimize and to ease the structures of programming languages for templates and contracts due to their mutual consistency
* To increase the system protection by saving interfaces on blockchain along with contracts

The platform has a multi-level system for ruling the rights to create and to edit the registries, contracts, pages, interface menu, parameters of tuning table. For controlling of access rights to elements of platform usually the special contracts are utilized which are smart laws, due to this the system of controlling the access is customizable and what is the most important it allows to monitor the transfer of access rights automatically.
