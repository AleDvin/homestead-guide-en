What is Apla?
********************************************************************************

Apla is a public blockchain platform for building digital ecosystems. The platform includes an Integrated Development Environment with a multi-level system for the management of access rights to data, interfaces, and smart contracts. The Apla platform is built on software of the EGAAS corporation (EGAAS S.A.). 

From this overview of the existing features of the Apla blockchain network, it can be inferred that, in terms of structure and functionality, Apla is significantly different from most of the existing blockchain platforms:
* The development and use of blockchain applications is carried out in autonomous programming environments with a defined quantity of members, called ecosystems
* Activities in ecosystems are based on creating registers and recording/modifying the data involved using smart contracts, whereas in most other blockchain platforms activities are based on exchanging transactions or messages between accounts
* Management of access permissions to registers, and relation management between ecosystem members are regulated by a set of rules called smart laws.

Technical implementation
********************************************************************************
The Apla blockchain platform is based on a peer-to-peer network. Full nodes of the network store an up-to-date version of the blockchain and a database, in which the current state of the platform is recorded. After having been verified, transactions are recorded in a new block, and the data is simultaneously updated in the database.

Contract itself is a basic construction for implementation of apps algorithms. The completed fragments of code are designed in a form of contracts, which ensure taking of incoming data from user or other contract, analysis of dataâ€™s correctness and implementation of the needed transactions. The language of contracts is a scripting language with a fast compilation into bite code, containing the needed set of functions for creation of registries and performing of any kind of transactions with records in them. 

The attached language of page templates description allows: 

* To simplify the writing of contracts interface 
* To optimize and to ease the structures of programming languages for templates and contracts due to their mutual consistency
* To increase the system protection by saving interfaces on blockchain along with contracts

The platform has a multi-level system for ruling the rights to create and to edit the registries, contracts, pages, interface menu, parameters of tuning table. For controlling of access rights to elements of platform usually the special contracts are utilized which are smart laws, due to this the system of controlling the access is customizable and what is the most important it allows to monitor the transfer of access rights automatically.
